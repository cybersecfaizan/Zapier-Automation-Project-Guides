## Introduction

Zapier is a powerful automation tool that allows businesses to connect different apps and services to streamline their workflows. By creating automated workflows, known as "Zaps," Zapier enables users to save time and reduce manual tasks by triggering actions across multiple apps based on specific events.


My objective for creating this repo is to clearly document how to set up a few Zaps so that you may automate repetitive  tasks.

## Business Use Cases

&nbsp;

Zapier can save time and enhace workflows for various teams across an organization. For example, a sales teams can automate lead management by connecting their CRM with email and calendar apps, marketing departments can automate their social media posting schedules, and HR can streamline the onboarding process by connecting applicant tracking systems with internal communication tools.

## Requirements

To take full advantage of Zapierâ€™s capabilities, you'll need at least a  Zapier Professional account, which offers access to premium features, including multi-step Zaps and advanced automation tools. **Zapier does offer a 14-day trial of premium features & apps.**

Additionally, integrating apps like Gmail, Google Drive, Slack, and others is essential for most projects to ensure that data flows smoothly between different platforms.
